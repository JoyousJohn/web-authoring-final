                        This paper analyzes the science behind modern running shoes and how recent technologies impacted the rate of injury in runners. These new advancements include nylon and carbon fiber plates, an addition in shoes that has let elite athletes break historical records, albeit it’s thought the speed offered by these shoes may prolong injuries.

                        This source investigates the connection between different physiological and biomechanical aspects of running economy in experienced distance runners. The studies conducted by the authors discovered that body mass, VO2max, lactate threshold, and stride length were all strongly related to running economy.

                        Written by doctors in exercise physiology, this book takes an interest in the psychological aspects of exercise and running, taking on the “running is 90% mental and 10% physical” adage. This research has resulted in one of the most extensively used and regarded exercise physiology textbooks.
