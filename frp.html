                        This paper analyzes the science behind modern running shoes and how recent technologies impacted the rate of injury in runners. These new advancements include nylon and carbon fiber plates, an addition in shoes that has let elite athletes break historical records, albeit thought that the speed offered by these shoes may prolong injuries.

The studies conducted by the authors discovered that body mass, VO2max, lactate threshold, and stride length were all strongly related to running economy.
