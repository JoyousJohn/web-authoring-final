        <h1>No Boundaries: The Physical and Somatic Freedom of Running</h1>

        <p>Running is the ultimate test of human endurance and willpower. It confronts the body and mind against the strongest enemy of all: oneself. In the athletic aspiration of pushing boundaries and exceeding both physical and mental limits, the pounding of the concrete, the gasping for oxygen, and the burning in the muscles all vanish. It’s a sport that demands respect and rewards those who remain determined and steadfast in the extra mile.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Arguably running’s greatest advantage as a form of exercise is the freedom it provides. Unlike other forms of exercise that require specific equipment or facilities, all that’s needed is a pair of comfortable shoes and suitable clothing. Runners can take on the streets of their neighborhoods and parks, persevere through the rough terrain of forest trails, set personal bests on tracks, enjoy the comfort of exercising in a gym or their own home on a treadmill, and even go barefoot on a beach fighting against the sands. The possibilities are endless and there are no limits to what can be explored. Every runner has their own preference to the routes they take on; each location and terrain having their own unique pros and cons, and there’s no wrong answer for the best area to work out.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Mentioning and comparing the thoughts of well-known professional ultra-runners and sprinters alike, such as Eliud Kipchoge and Usain Bolt, to my preference and argument for long distance and trail running being my favorite, it’s useful to analyze each of these areas and distances to emphasize this sport’s unique freedom that casts a special attraction to beginners of all skill levels.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Outdoors</h2>

        <p>Running outdoors can often be summarized into three primary overarching categories; road running, track running, and trail running. Accessible to everyone, it’s easy to start running in the outdoors with minimal, if any, specialized equipment needed. Each of these areas offers unique challenges and benefits, allowing for a diverse and exciting experience – including the ability to explore new areas, connect with nature, and challenge oneself physically and mentally. Road running provides a smooth and consistent surface for those who want to focus on speed and endurance. Track running offers a controlled environment for precise training and competition. Trail running allows for a more immersive and scenic experience, with varying terrain and elevation providing a challenge for even the most experienced runners.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Running in the open air while surrounded by nature can be especially satisfying. The scenery and clean air can be energizing and motivational, and the constantly shifting terrain can keep training exciting and difficult. Each step taken can be a chance to engage with the surrounding nature and find new roads and trails, whether running on a flat trail or up a steep mountain. Outdoor running has several advantages outside merely providing a physical workout. The chance to interact with nature and enjoy the outdoors in a more personal and immersive way is one of the most obvious advantages. Running outside allows full engagement with nature and to enjoy the sights, sounds, and fragrances of a route’s surroundings.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Eliud Kipchoge, a Kenyan long-distance runner who is widely considered one of the greatest marathon runners of all time, gives credit to his successful career beginning with his 2 mile runs to and back from school as a child, which revealed his talent and interest in outdoor running (Runner’s World). Actually a large portion of the world’s great distance runners are Kenyans, and many give the same such history. Dennis Kimimetto, one of Kipchoge’s close friends and opponents who held the marathon WR prior to Kipchoge, gives an arguably even more impressive story, remembering how he had to “run to school when I was late. It was around three to four kilometers from my home. Also, at lunchtime, I had to go back home to eat lunch and then back to school” (Athletics Illustrated).
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Running outdoors can also offer a sense of community and connection to others who share the love of the outdoors and physical activity. Many communities offer running groups or clubs that provide a supportive environment for runners of all abilities. Joining a running group can be a great way to meet new people, find new running routes, and stay motivated and accountable to ambitious fitness goals. Even Kipchoge believes that “running is a team sport. It is no longer an individual event as people think” (Olympics.com) and has a dream of “winning all six Abbott World Marathon Majors,” six of the most prestigious marathons in the world (Frontline).
        </p>

        <h2>Road running</h2>

        <p>Perhaps the most common and widely recognized form of running, as its name implies, road running typically takes place on paved roads, sidewalks, or other similar surfaces. 
        </p>

        <h3>Road Running: Distance Running</h3>

        <p>Road runners typically focus on distance, using pavement and asphalt to build endurance and speed, providing an excellent opportunity for runners to challenge themselves by covering long distances. With the expansive and interconnected networks of roads spanning cities and towns, runners can easily plot out long-distance routes and enjoy the freedom of running for hours on end.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I’m personally a big fan of distance running and naturally end up on the roads around my neighborhoods. Even after my competitive cross country career concluded I still find myself on streets when I don’t have trails available to me and have to agree with Kipchoge’s “people ask me why I run. It is for life and to inspire the younger generation to love sport and live a happy and full life. I can’t imagine a life without distance running”’s argument (World Athletics). 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Modern science also shows that mentality has a very heavy weight in distance running rather than physiological limits hampering performance, well-reiterated in an MIT study summarized by journalist Mariska van Sprundel claiming that “the decision to stop running has nothing to do with your muscles or energy system and everything to do with your brain. Experts are in unanimous agreement that it is the brain that controls physical exercise” (MIT). I surprisingly enjoy this unexpected aspect of the sport as it truly demonstrates human determination; endorphins during a runner’s high are an excellent pro as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Road Running: Races & Events</h3>

        <p>From mid-distance 5ks to marathons and even ultra-marathons, the majority of races occur on outdoor roads. It takes discipline, dedication, and mental toughness to complete these races, as well as proper training and preparation. Despite the challenges, many runners find that the sense of accomplishment and pride they feel after completing a road race is worth all the hard work. Distance running truly provides an opportunity to see just how far the human body can go. It’s on my bucket list to complete a marathon and eventually an ultra one day.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Some of the most powerful arguments for long-distance, endurance running come from world-class athletes that surpass limits not thought humanly possible. One such figure is Eluid Kipchoge, who’s widely considered the best marathon runner of all time. Winning nearly all of the elite races he ran in and being the first man to break the 2 hour marathon barrier, he even “compared this run as going to visiting the Moon and returning back to Earth.”
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Trail Running</h2>

        <p>Trail running is a dynamic and engaging way to experience the great outdoors. Unlike road running, trail running requires the use of varying degrees of physical and mental skill, as each trail offers unique challenges and obstacles. Whether running up steep hills, navigating rocky terrain, or crossing streams, trail running provides a thrilling and stimulating experience that tests both the body and the mind. Trail running is also a great way to escape the monotony of running on pavement or track, as each trail provides different scenery and surroundings.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>I personally enjoy trail running over any other kind, especially due to the sense of adventure of never seeing the same thing twice and the ability to explore in solitude. The rough terrain is also extremely satisfying to train on as I personally see my progress enduring inclines much more obvious than my speed improving in the woods. After nine years of competitively running cross country in school, I found a new found love for trail running exploring my local trail networks during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantines. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Many current trail champions were in similar situations as me, such as Clare Gallagher, another well-known ultrarunner in the professional community. She grew up running cross country, track – both indoor and outdoor – and came to the same conclusion as me, that trail running and enjoying nature is better than any other sport, after spending time backpacking which sparked her interest in ultras (Lifetime).
        </p>

        <h3>Trail Running: Ultras</h3>

        <p>A large portion of extreme running events actually take place off the roads. These trail-based ultra marathons are a grueling and demanding test of physical and mental endurance. Covering distances of 50 miles or more, these races require a level of training and preparation beyond what’s necessary or let alone imaginable for most other running events. These races are typically longer than traditional marathons and take place on challenging terrain, including steep inclines, rocky paths, and in weather conditions. Racers often have to carry their own supplies and navigate the course with limited aid stations.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Some incredible athletes take this a step further; elites such as Emelie Forsberg specialize in mountaineering, mountain running, and sky running. These categories build upon trail running as a hobby by truly pushing the human bounds and require immense determination and strengths to conquer these steep inclines, rocky terrain, and often unpredictable weather conditions. Like many others, she echoes the common consensus stating that “I remember my first very low moment in life, I was about 20 years old or so and was having a tough time for a number of different reasons. But I had running which was the only highlight of the day for me. I think this was really how my relationship with running started and continued to grow over those months” (Vert).
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>It’s likely no surprise that Forseberg naturally met and married another legend in the field: Kilian Jornet, another trail runner often considered one of the greatest trail runners of all time and a household name for those involved in these extreme sports. Jornet’s track record spans nearly every environment in dozens of countries.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Gallagher broke records for these too, setting course records at the CCC, a 100-­kilometer race around the Mont Blanc massif in the French, Italian, and Swiss Alps (Lifetime).
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Track Running</h2>

        <p>Often seen as targeted to field athletes, track running can be a highly competitive and technical sport. With a standardized oval shape and measured and marked lanes, track running is ideal for sprinters and middle-distance runners who require precise and controlled environments to optimize performance. Although I’m not much interested in short-distance running, it certainly has its benefits and large following as well – sprint events being some of the most highly anticipated events in the Olympic games. For middle-distance runners, track running offers the chance to compete in shorter distance races, where strategy and endurance play a significant role in securing a victory. This could interest individuals more focussed on strategy over the course of just a few minutes rather than requiring the endurance to run miles on end.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Many abstracts of all distances support the MIT study, each studying performance of athletes to understand more about the human body and each recognizing the immense benefits provided by running (Crossing the Golden Training Divide). No matter the location, the sport’s benefits have been widely recognized.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Indoor Running [Treadmill]</h2>

        <p>Running indoors too has its advantages, the ability to have full control over the environment is one the largest. Enjoying a more predictable and consistent workout, treadmills allow selection of a specific pace and incline to maintain a consistent level of effort. Additionally, running on a treadmill can help reduce the risk of injury by providing a stable and even surface to run on, though I personally call the treadmill “the dreadmill” due to its lack of “randomness”, such as the always differing terrain, incline, and direction the outdoors offers.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Running indoors can also be a great way to stay motivated and focused on a workout regarding the ability to still consume visual entertainment. This is one more of my few kudos I give to treadmill running as being able to watch some tv shows or movies takes attention away from the energy exertion and exhaustion.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Overall, the versatility of running makes it a fantastic choice for people of all fitness levels and preferences. Whether preferring the solitude of running alone, the social aspect of running in groups, or the excitement of running in organized races, there is a form of running that can suit every need and interest. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Alongside the world-class runners who each excel in amazing human feats, every single individual athlete and running hobbyist has their own valid argument for their preferences, and this culmination truly portrays and there’s no wrong answer to the arguments discussed above – I’m a big supporter of trail running, and urge people to go out and enjoy the freedom and endless possibilities that running has to offer!
