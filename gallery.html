    <p id="gallery-sum">Running likely provides some of the best and most ample opportunities to photograph one's journey exploring the outdoors and documenting the joys and memories made revolving around the sport. I competitively ran cross country for over eight years beginning all the way in elementary school and ran dozens upon dozens of 5K races, meeting so many phenominal athletes, many of which I'm still friends with and occasionally run with almost a decade later. All these races and daily practices after school gave me countless exhilarating experiences, and I was actually amazed at how difficult it was to find photos I took during these practices and races. Nonetheless, it's important to recognize the expansive social life a beginner will experience once getting involved in the sport, races, and running clubs! :)<br><br>

    Some of my favorite running experiences and memories surprisingly came out of the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine. I live in a very rural area; I essentially live in a forest on a one-lane, dead-end, boulders-on-one-side and cliff drop-off on the other side, road. There's a trail head at the end of my road and for my entire life I always thought it was a simple, small maybe one-mile or less loop, and never went to visit it. One day while jogging on my street during quarantine (since I didn't have much else to do), I decided to jog in and was dismayed: already a mile in and I reached a fork, I took one of the trails and reached another fork, took that one and reached a crossing with multiple paths, I took one and the trail just kept going: it wasn't just a mile loop. I spent every single day for the next several months waking up, eating, and running a new trail - this marked the beginning of my love for trailrunning. I never looked at a map so I could explore blindly and began making my own. Eventually when new trails were located hours away, which were too difficult to reach, I researched the forest and found out there were roughly 60 miles of trails shared by multiple networks that my street had access to. I ran hundreds of miles that summer adventuring into the woods and photographed everything neat I found, photos below, and ever since then have recommended trailrunning (jogging) to people who claim they don't have the stamina to run long distance. Being able to spend so much time outdoors were some of my favorite and best recent memories.
