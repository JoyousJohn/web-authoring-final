    <p id="gallery-sum">Running likely provides some of the best and most ample opportunities to photograph one's journey exploring the outdoors and documenting the joys and memories made revolving around the sport. I competitively ran cross country for over eight years beginning all the way in elementary school and ran dozens upon dozens of 5K races, meeting so many phenominal athletes, many of which I'm still friends with and occasionally run with almost a decade later. All these races and daily practices after school gave me countless exhilarating experiences, and I was actually amazed at how difficult it was to find photos I took during these practices and races. Nonetheless, it's important to recognize the expansive social life a beginner will experience once getting involved in the sport, races, and running clubs! :)<br><br>

    Surprisingly, some of my favorite running experiences and memories came out of the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. I live in a very rural area -- essneitlly a forest -- on a one-lane, dead-end road flanked by boulders on one side and a cliff drop-off on the other. At the end of my street lies a trailhead that I always thought was just a simple, small loop, perhaps a mile or less, and never explored it. One day while jogging on my street during quarantine (since I didn't have much else to do) I decided to venture in and was dismayed: already a mile in and I reached a fork. I took one of the trails and reached another fork, took that one and reached a crossing with multiple paths, I took one of those and the trail just kept going: it wasn't just a mile loop. This was when I discovered a newfound love for trail running. I never looked a map so I could explore blindly and instead created my own. I spent every single day for the next several months waking up, eating, and running a new trail. This experience marked the beginning of my larger passion for trail running. Eventually when new trails were located hours away, which were too difficult to reach, I researched the forest and found out there were roughly 60 miles of trails shared by multiple networks that my street had access to. I spent that summer running hundreds of miles, photographing everything interesting I encountered, and creating cherished memories. Since then, I have recommended trail running to those who claim they lack the stamina for long-distance running, and spending so much time outdoors remains among my favorite and most cherished recent experiences.
