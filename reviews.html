            <h1>Advanced Running Metrics on Your Wrist: Galaxy Watch Active 2 Review</h1>

            <p>With a variety of features designed to peak the interest of fitness enthusiasts, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is Samsung's latest venture into providing an elegant smartwatch targeted towards athletes of any ability level -- but is it worth the highered $280+ price tag? Read on to discover the thoughts from a casual runner!
            </p>

            <article>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">I should first disclose that this is the first flagship watch I've ever invested in. My inability to extensively compare my experience with this device to others in the market shouldn't diminish the significance of my review, however, as it instead focusses on my honest experiences having no expectations plagued by (possibly overpriced) rival watches. My thoughts are based on the raw surprises and disappointments I've gathered over my time with this sleek device! I'll focus more on my direct usage with the watch rather than the technical specs.</p>

            <p>Long seen as Android's solution to match the Apple Watch, Samsung is now one of a handful of manufacturers catching up to Apple's market share. Only releasing months after Samsung's first Galaxy Watch, the device listens to the most prominent feedback fans gave and continues its attempt to provide an affordable, advanced fitness watch to the masses - less than half the price of the current Apple Watch! The device is cheaper than its flagship Galaxy Watch series and drops features, such as the rotating bezel, for a more sleek and streamlined approach. The simulated haptic scrolling around the circumference of the watch, via the new touch-bezel, emulates the old scrolling crown quite well, and provides an exceptional simplicity in navigating the various menus. The result of clearing all this space results in a gleaming slab of glass that tapers off on each edge, providing a beautiful round display free of interruptions and does a great job and concealing where the screen and bezel meet, especially when using black backgrounds. I especially enjoy how circular smart watches remind of actual wristwatches more than the square odd appearance Apple's watches portray. Accepting 20mm or 22mm straps depending on the model, the size of the larger watch fits fine on my wrist and it's easy to forget I'm wearing it, even when jogging. The top home button and bottom back button click pleasantly but I find it easier just to swipe to return to previous menus. 
            </p>

            <p>Almost all of Samsung's watches run their proprietary Tizen operating system, which doesn't have the largest third-party app store or developer platform, but the in-house software feels polished and more than sufficient. The watch includes all the expected features of a smart watch, such as the instant notifications (which even show my security camera feeds from around my house which is pretty awesome), weather, hundreds of watch faces, including a 3rd party platform for users to fully create their own, NFC for contactless payments, music playback, sleep tracking, and one of my favorite features, the ability to make and accept calls from the watch itself. Spending an extra $200 for the LTE variant provides even a better experience not needing a phone nearby with its internet SIM. But where the watch really takes it away is its focus on fitness.
            </p>

            <p>The “Active” series delivers athletes of any skill level an experience tailored for exercise; 39 workout modes each featuring unique metric tracking. My exercises primarily consist of running and hiking, and I was surprised to discover the watch supports tracking multiple types within one workout. The heart rate sensor rivaled the accuracy of my Polar chest strap and still read accurately when deterred by sweat. The screen is beyond bright enough to still be seen in direct sunlight and checking basic statistics while still in a workout is easy enough. The watch provides, at least for me, an easier way to control audio and music playing in earbuds while running opposed to having to exhaust myself (yes this is true in long distance running) raising my arms all the way up to tap my earbuds directly. Where the watch really, really shines though is the post-workout analytics and metrics. Data is sent to the Samsung Health app and is analyzed to extents I wasn't expecting. In addition to the trivial time, distance, and heart rate, advanced metrics are generated: asymmetry, contact time, flight time, vertical oscillation, stride, cadence, regularity, and stiffness. I didn't even know what half of these meant before going on a run with the device let alone thought they'd be useful, assuming Samsung just wanted to fill their app with more visual data, but after much research actually found these metrics really useful in my quest to improve my wobbly form! I'm extremely satisfied with the watch's fitness-oriented capabilities.
            </p>

            <p>The watch does possess some negatives I was disappointed with though. Battery life. I wasn't expecting to have to charge my watch every several days, and even every 2-3 days when I have continuous heart rate and GPS tracking enabled. Ouch. The watch also has and supports blood oxygen readings, but this feature hasn't gained approval in the United States yet. Bummer. Running for an hour plus still generates a VO2 max reading, however. The watch also only supports Samsung's proprietary Samsung Pay and Bixby, no Google Pay or Google Assistant which I'm used to. (Note: would be available on later models!)
            </p>

            <p>This is my first flagship smart watch, so it wouldn't take much to surpass my expectations, but I'm satisfied with what Samsung offers me for the price. It's one of the most cost-effective watches on the market and is likely an ideal consideration for anyone searching for or preferring a circular face over a boring rectangle. And unlike the dominating Apple Watch, this device supports both iOS and Android.

            <!-- SHOE -->

            <h1 id="shoe">The Do-it-all Shoe: New Balance 1080v12</h1>

            <p style="font-style:italic">The v12 is New Balance’s latest running shoe in its 1080 line, claiming to provide a shoe capable of handling anything thrown at it. With a hefty $160 price tag, is it actually worthy and capable of all the marketing NB has been giving it.
            </p>

            <article>

            <img src="img/reviews/1080.png"  style="max-width: 100%">

            <p>First launching in 2006 with the 1080v1, the 1080 line has been a cult favorite among runners clamoring to try out the latest max-cushioning running shoe science and tech. The 1080v12 is New Balance’s newest, albeit expensive, attempt and growing its market share over the daily trainer shoe even further. Lacking any nylon or carbon fiber plates and with a generous amount of protective cushioning, the shoe focusses on endurance training and recovery rather than raceday. 
            </p>

            <p>Running in the Asics Cumulus and Nimbus series for a decade throughout my cross country career, I finally decided to invest heavily in a top-of-the-line running shoe claimed to handle any distance. Although not a max-cushion shoe, the stack height blew me away when I first tried these shoes on. I was amazed at how comfortable the Fresh Foam midsole felt when I first stood up and instantly felt taller and faster. The 8mm drop provided a springy bounciness jogging the Dick’s isles I had never experienced before, and I instantly looked back at all my years running where I missed out on a comfort experience I hoped would last. The v12 even stole the show from the celebrated Hoka Cliftons and Bondi I was excited to try on for the first time.
            </p>

            <p>400 miles later and I can confidently confirm that this shoe has lowered my PRs and made long runs and recovery easier. This shoe may be the definition of the “as walking on clouds” cliche and really need to be tried on to truly comprehend this level of support and I’m genuinely surprised at how long it took the  running shoe industry to discover the science of increased midsole foam. I’m a heel striker and really felt the momentum provided by the drop and aided by the lifted forefoot. Although not even a stability shoe, I believe the shoe, in part with my custom orthotics, may be assisting me in my journey to correct my pronation and shift to a neutral midfoot strike as well. Also although not a trail shoe with its knit upper and road-orientated grip, it’s been able to handle double digit trail run rides just fine, experiencing both mud and loose-dirt.
            </p>

            <p>The stretchy “Hypoknit” upper occasionally excessively rubs against my sock in an irritating fashion, especially when my feet begin to swell on longer runs (thus I didn’t encounter this issue when first experimenting with the shoe) in high heat. I surprisingly haven’t encountered this with the static uppers on my previous shoes, but wearing thicker socks seems to have helped. Furthermore the toe cap just feels tight sometimes. I suspect this may be from my foot sliding forward on ground contact with an insufficiently tight tongue. I bought multiple sizes of the shoe before settling on one and thought I had the perfect fit, but may still be slightly too large. A more narrow shoe, many width options being a unique pro exclusive to NB, may be the answer when I purchase my next shoe.
            </p>

            <p>The New Balance 1080v12 is a highly impressive and reliable running shoe that offers exceptional comfort and support for runners of all levels. With its advanced Fresh Foam X midsole technology, this shoe delivers a smooth and responsive ride, while also providing ample cushioning and stability. The New Balance 1080v12 is definitely worth considering the next pair of running shoes for any skill level, and I’m excited to see what comes next out of the 1080 line!
